# üö® CRITICAL: Federation v2 Migration Required

## Current Status: BROKEN

The Cosmo Router cannot start due to missing `supergraphSdl` in the configuration. Services are still using legacy Yoga/Apollo/Mesh implementations that MUST be removed.

## Error
```
"could not load GraphQL schema for data source 0: no string found for key """
```

## Requirements

- ‚úÖ Implement **Federation v2** for all services
- ‚úÖ Use **Federated SSE** for subscriptions
- ‚ùå **NO** Yoga, Apollo Server, or GraphQL Mesh
- ‚ùå **NO** cloud dependencies

## Migration Status

- [ ] Claude Service - Still using Yoga
- [ ] Git Service - Still using Yoga
