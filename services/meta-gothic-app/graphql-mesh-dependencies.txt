# GraphQL Mesh Dependencies to Remove After Migration

These dependencies should be removed after successfully migrating to GraphQL Yoga:

## Production Dependencies
- @graphql-mesh/runtime
- @graphql-tools/executor-http  
- @graphql-tools/graphql-file-loader
- @graphql-tools/load
- @graphql-tools/utils (check if used elsewhere)
- @graphql-tools/wrap

## Dev Dependencies  
- @graphql-mesh/cli
- @graphql-mesh/graphql
- @graphql-mesh/plugin-mock
- @graphql-mesh/transform-federation

## Note
Keep these installed until the migration is complete and validated.
graphql-yoga is already installed and ready for the migration.
