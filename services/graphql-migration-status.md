# GraphQL Migration Status

## ✅ Completed

### 1. **repo-agent-service**: Successfully migrated to GraphQL Yoga
   - Running on port 3004
   - Three implementations available:
     - `index-yoga.ts` - Basic Yoga implementation
     - `index-yoga-simple.ts` - Simple non-federated version
     - `index-yoga-federation.ts` - **Active** - Full federation support
   - All queries and mutations functional
   - Apollo Federation v2.10 compliant

### 2. **claude-service**: Successfully migrated to GraphQL Yoga
   - Running on port 3002
   - Three implementations available:
     - `index-yoga.ts` - Basic federation attempt (has issues)
     - `index-yoga-simple.ts` - **Active** - Working non-federated version
     - `index-yoga-federation.ts` - Full federation support (ready to activate)
   - Fixed resolver compatibility issues:
     - Health resolver returning correct schema fields
     - Added missing agent runs schema
     - Fixed TypeScript type issues
   - All queries, mutations, and subscriptions functional

### 3. **Gateway**: Yoga-based mesh gateway fully operational
   - Running on port 3000
   - Successfully stitching both services using schema stitching
   - Both services fully integrated:
     - Claude Service queries/mutations working
     - Repo Agent Service queries/mutations working
   - GraphiQL interface available at http://localhost:3000/graphql
   - Can execute federated queries across both services

## 📋 Next Steps
1. Switch claude-service to federation mode (currently using simple mode)
2. Implement subscription support in gateway
3. Add GraphQL Mesh transforms for additional features:
   - Rate limiting
   - Response caching
   - Field masking
   - Custom directives
4. Performance testing and optimization
5. Add monitoring and observability

## 🚀 Benefits Achieved
- ✅ Modern GraphQL stack with Yoga (migrated from Mercurius)
- ✅ Both services successfully migrated and working
- ✅ Federation-ready architecture
- ✅ Schema stitching working across services
- ✅ Foundation for GraphQL Mesh capabilities
- ✅ Improved error handling and logging
- ✅ Better TypeScript support

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Current Architecture:
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│   Yoga Mesh Gateway (:3000) │
│   (Schema Stitching)        │
└──────────┬─────────┬────────┘
           │         │
     ┌─────▼───┐ ┌───▼─────┐
     │ Claude  │ │  Repo   │
     │ Service │ │  Agent  │
     │ (:3002) │ │ (:3004) │
     │  Yoga   │ │  Yoga   │
     └─────────┘ └─────────┘
```

### Available Queries (via Gateway):
- Claude Service: `health`, `sessions`, `session`, `performanceMetrics`, `agentRun`, `agentRuns`, etc.
- Repo Agent: `gitStatus`, `scanAllRepositories`, `repositoryDetails`, `isRepositoryClean`, etc.
- Cross-service queries work seamlessly
