# Documentation Cleanup Summary - January 6, 2025

## Overview
This document summarizes the documentation cleanup performed to remove superseded ADRs and update all references to reflect the current GraphQL Yoga architecture.

## ADRs Removed (Fully Superseded)

### 1. ADR-013: Mercurius Over Apollo Server
- **Reason**: Fully superseded by ADR-019 (GraphQL Yoga migration)
- **Status**: Deleted

### 2. ADR-015: GitHub API Hybrid Strategy  
- **Reason**: Superseded by ADR-021 (Direct REST wrapping)
- **Status**: Deleted

### 3. ADR-018: GraphQL Mesh for Federation Implementation
- **Reason**: Superseded by ADR-019 (this ADR tried to use Mesh with Mercurius, which failed)
- **Status**: Deleted

## ADRs Updated

### 1. ADR-014: GraphQL Federation Architecture
- Updated from Mercurius to GraphQL Yoga implementation
- Added current architecture diagram
- Updated code examples to reflect Yoga + Mesh
- Added performance metrics from actual implementation

### 2. ADR-020: OpenAPI to GraphQL Transformation Pattern
- Changed status from "Accepted" to "Proposed (Future Use)"
- Added note explaining ADR-021 was chosen for GitHub
- Updated examples to be generic (not GitHub-specific)
- Clarified this remains valid for future REST API integrations

### 3. ADR-index.md
- Removed entries for deleted ADRs (013, 015, 018)
- Updated ADR-014 status to "Accepted (Updated for Yoga)"
- Fixed decision relationship diagram
- Updated technology stack dependencies

## Other Documentation Updates

### 1. ADR-005: GraphQL-First Architecture
- Updated framework references from Mercurius to GraphQL Yoga

### 2. ADR-012: Fastify Over Express
- Updated GraphQL integration examples to use Yoga
- Changed performance claims to match Yoga

### 3. Various Migration Documents
- Updated references in migration guides to point to correct ADRs
- Fixed ADR references in completion reports

## Documents Preserved for Historical Context

The following documents were kept as they provide valuable historical context about the decision-making process:

1. **federation-alternatives-analysis.md** - Shows the analysis that led to choosing GraphQL Mesh
2. **hybrid-federation-findings.md** - Documents why the Mercurius + Apollo Router approach failed
3. **migration-guide-mercurius-to-yoga.md** - Useful guide for the completed migration
4. **github-openapi-integration-findings.md** - Documents the analysis that led to ADR-021
5. **graphql-mesh-implementation-status.md** - Shows the implementation progress

## Current State

After cleanup, the documentation now accurately reflects:
- GraphQL Yoga is used for all services
- GraphQL Mesh provides the federation gateway
- GitHub REST API is wrapped directly (not via OpenAPI)
- All UI components use GraphQL (no direct REST calls)
- Performance is excellent (2.32ms average latency)

## Verification

All remaining ADRs are either:
- âœ… **Accepted**: Implemented and working
- ðŸ“‹ **Proposed**: Valid patterns for future use
- No superseded ADRs remain in the index

The documentation is now consistent with the current implementation and provides a clear path forward.
