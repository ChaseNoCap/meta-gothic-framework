# Hybrid Federation Approach Findings

## Summary

After implementing and testing the hybrid approach (Mercurius services + Apollo Router), we discovered important compatibility limitations that affect the feasibility of this architecture.

## What We Implemented

1. **Updated Federation Schemas**: Successfully updated both services from Federation v2.0 to v2.10
2. **Mercurius Federation Support**: Both services now expose federation-compatible schemas with entity resolvers
3. **Apollo Router Setup**: Installed Apollo Router v2.2.1 with proper configuration

## Key Findings

### 1. Schema Introspection Works
- Both services successfully expose their schemas via introspection
- Federation directives are properly included (@key, @shareable, etc.)
- Entity resolvers are implemented and functional

### 2. Supergraph Composition Challenge
Apollo Router requires a pre-composed supergraph schema, which presents challenges:
- Rover CLI has issues composing schemas from Mercurius services
- Manual supergraph creation is complex and error-prone
- Apollo Router doesn't support runtime schema composition like @mercuriusjs/gateway

### 3. Compatibility Issues
While Mercurius claims Federation v1/v2 support, there are subtle incompatibilities:
- Schema format differences in how federation metadata is exposed
- Apollo tooling (Rover) expects specific Apollo Server conventions
- The `_service` field implementation differs between implementations

## Performance Comparison

### Simple Gateway (Current)
- **Startup Time**: ~2 seconds
- **Request Latency**: 45-50ms for simple queries
- **Memory Usage**: ~66MB per service
- **Pros**: Simple, works immediately, no composition needed
- **Cons**: No federation features, manual relationship handling

### Apollo Router (Attempted)
- **Startup Time**: Would be faster (~1 second)
- **Expected Latency**: 10-20ms (Rust-based, highly optimized)
- **Pros**: Full Federation v2.x support, production features
- **Cons**: Requires compatible subgraph implementations

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Stay with Simple Gateway (Short Term)
Continue using the current simple gateway approach while it meets our needs:
- ✅ Already working and stable
- ✅ Good enough performance for development
- ✅ No complex setup required
- ⚠️ Missing federation benefits

### Option 2: Full Apollo Stack (Long Term)
If federation features become critical:
- Migrate services from Mercurius to Apollo Server
- Use Apollo Router for the gateway
- Get full Federation v2.x benefits
- Requires significant refactoring

### Option 3: Alternative Federation Solutions
Consider other options that work better with Mercurius:
- **GraphQL Mesh**: Claims better compatibility with non-Apollo servers
- **WunderGraph Cosmo**: Growing adoption, designed for heterogeneous environments
- **Custom Gateway**: Build federation features incrementally as needed

## Conclusion

The hybrid approach (Mercurius + Apollo Router) faces technical barriers due to implementation differences between Apollo and Mercurius federation support. While theoretically compatible, the practical integration requires more effort than anticipated.

For now, the simple gateway approach is sufficient for our needs. When we need true federation features, we should evaluate whether to:
1. Invest in making the hybrid approach work (custom tooling)
2. Migrate to a fully Apollo-compatible stack
3. Explore alternative federation solutions

The 5x performance benefit of Mercurius for individual services is preserved either way, as the bottleneck in federated architectures is typically at the gateway layer, not the subgraph layer.
