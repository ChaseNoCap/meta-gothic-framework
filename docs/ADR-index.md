# Architecture Decision Records (ADR) Index

This index provides an overview of all architectural decisions for the metaGOTHIC framework. ADRs have been consolidated by topic area for easier navigation.

## Status Legend
- **âœ… Implemented**: Decision implemented and proven in production
- **ðŸ“‹ Proposed**: Decision documented but not yet implemented
- **ðŸš§ Partial**: Some aspects implemented, others pending

## Consolidated ADRs

### [ADR-Infrastructure](./ADR-Infrastructure.md) âœ…
**Package Management and CI/CD**  
Covers Git submodules architecture, automated publishing, NPM authentication, and the meta repository pattern. Fully implemented with 8 packages in production.

**Key Decisions**:
- Git submodules for package independence
- Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Tag-based publishing to GitHub Packages
- Unified NPM_TOKEN authentication

### [ADR-Federation-Architecture](./ADR-Federation-Architecture.md) âœ…
**GraphQL Federation with Cosmo Router**  
Documents the complete Federation v2 implementation using Cosmo Router, SSE for subscriptions, and shared type patterns. Fully implemented and operational.

**Key Decisions**:
- Cosmo Router for federation gateway
- Federation v2 protocol
- SSE for real-time subscriptions
- Shared types across services
- Local-first development

### [ADR-Architecture-Patterns](./ADR-Architecture-Patterns.md) ðŸš§
**Core Framework Patterns**  
Defines GOTHIC pattern, event-driven architecture, and multi-layer caching strategy. Conceptually defined with partial implementation.

**Key Decisions**:
- GOTHIC (GitHub Orchestrated Tooling for Hierarchical Intelligent Containers)
- Redis Pub/Sub for events (planned)
- Three-layer caching architecture
- Event-driven service communication

### [ADR-AI-Development](./ADR-AI-Development.md) ðŸ“‹
**AI Integration and SDLC Patterns**  
Progressive context loading for token optimization and SDLC state machine for workflow management. Proposed patterns for future AI enhancement.

**Key Decisions**:
- Hierarchical context loading (1-4 levels)
- Token budget optimization
- SDLC phase state machine
- AI-assisted development workflows

### [ADR-Monitoring](./ADR-Monitoring.md) âœ…
**CI/CD Dashboard and Metrics Collection**  
Systematic metrics collection across all repositories with centralized dashboard visualization. Fully operational.

**Key Decisions**:
- Metrics collection during CI/CD
- JSON-based data persistence
- Real-time dashboard updates
- Historical trend tracking

### [ADR-Future-Patterns](./ADR-Future-Patterns.md) ðŸ“‹
**Reserved Patterns for Future Use**  
Documents patterns considered but not implemented, like OpenAPI transformation. Reserved for future integrations.

**Currently Contains**:
- OpenAPI to GraphQL transformation pattern
- Placeholder for future architectural patterns
