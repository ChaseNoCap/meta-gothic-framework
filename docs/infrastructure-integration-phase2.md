# Infrastructure Integration Phase 2 - Event-Driven Traceability Complete

## üìÖ Date: June 3, 2025

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### Week 2: Event-Driven Traceability Implementation

#### 1. Event System Integration
- ‚úÖ Examined event-system package API and capabilities
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive event type definitions for all services
- ‚úÖ Implemented type-safe event contracts with TypeScript

#### 2. Service-Level Event Implementation

**Claude Service**
- ‚úÖ Created `ClaudeSessionManagerWithEvents` with @Emits decorators:
  - `claude.session.started`
  - `claude.session.completed`
  - `claude.session.failed`
  - `claude.command.executed`
  - `claude.agentRun.created`
- ‚úÖ Added @Traces decorators for performance monitoring
- ‚úÖ Integrated request-scoped event bus with correlation IDs

**Repo Agent Service**
- ‚úÖ Created `GitServiceWithEvents` with @Emits decorators:
  - `repo.status.queried`
  - `repo.commit.created`
  - `repo.push.completed`
  - `repo.scan.completed`
  - `repo.branch.created`
  - `repo.command.executed`
- ‚úÖ Added @Traces decorators with appropriate thresholds
- ‚úÖ Integrated with logging and correlation IDs

**Gateway Service**
- ‚úÖ Created event-enabled GitHub resolvers with event emission:
  - `github.api.started`
  - `github.api.completed`
  - `github.workflow.triggered`
- ‚úÖ Added rate limit monitoring through events
- ‚úÖ Implemented correlation ID propagation to downstream services

#### 3. GraphQL Operation Tracking
- ‚úÖ Created `useEventTracking` Yoga plugin
- ‚úÖ Tracks all GraphQL operations:
  - Query start/completion
  - Mutation start/completion
  - Subscription lifecycle
- ‚úÖ Automatic slow operation detection
- ‚úÖ Integrated with all three services

#### 4. Event Logging Middleware
- ‚úÖ Created `LoggingEventBus` that logs all events
- ‚úÖ Event categorization by severity:
  - Errors logged at error level
  - Performance issues at warn level
  - Normal operations at info/debug
- ‚úÖ Correlation ID included in all event logs
- ‚úÖ Separate event log directory for analysis

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Patterns Implemented

### Event Bus Pattern
```typescript
// Request-scoped event bus with correlation
const eventBus = createRequestEventBus(correlationId);

// Service integration
const sessionManager = new ClaudeSessionManagerWithEvents(
  eventBus,
  requestLogger,
  correlationId
);
```

### Decorator Pattern
```typescript
@Emits('claude.session.started', {
  payloadMapper: (input) => ({ /* structured payload */ })
})
@Traces({ threshold: 100 })
async createSession() { /* ... */ }
```

### Event Type System
```typescript
// Type-safe events
type MetaGothicEvent = 
  | ClaudeSessionStartedEvent
  | GitCommitCreatedEvent
  | GraphQLQueryCompletedEvent
  // ... etc

// Type guards for filtering
if (isClaudeEvent(event)) { /* ... */ }
```

## üìä Performance Tracking Features

### Automatic Performance Monitoring
- @Traces decorator on all major operations
- Configurable thresholds per operation type:
  - Claude operations: 500ms
  - Git operations: 200ms  
  - Gateway operations: 1000ms
- Slow operation events emitted automatically

### Performance Event Data
```json
{
  "type": "performance.slowOperation.detected",
  "payload": {
    "service": "claude-service",
    "operation": "executeCommand",
    "duration": 1250,
    "threshold": 500,
    "correlationId": "abc123"
  }
}
```

## üîç Observability Improvements

### End-to-End Request Tracing
1. Gateway receives request ‚Üí generates correlation ID
2. Correlation ID passed to all downstream services
3. All events include correlation ID
4. Complete request flow can be reconstructed

### Event Categories
- **Service Events**: Claude sessions, Git operations
- **API Events**: GitHub API calls, GraphQL operations
- **Performance Events**: Slow operations, timeouts
- **Cache Events**: Hits, misses, invalidations

### Real-Time Monitoring Ready
- Event bus architecture supports WebSocket broadcasting
- Events structured for dashboard consumption
- Performance metrics available in real-time

## üìà Benefits Achieved

1. **Complete Operation Visibility**
   - Every significant operation emits events
   - Full lifecycle tracking (start/complete/fail)
   - Performance metrics on all operations

2. **Debugging Capabilities**
   - Correlation IDs link all related events
   - Structured payloads for analysis
   - Performance bottlenecks automatically flagged

3. **Production Monitoring**
   - GitHub API rate limits tracked
   - Slow operations detected and logged
   - Error events with full context

4. **Dashboard Integration Ready**
   - Events structured for real-time updates
   - WebSocket broadcasting foundation in place
   - Performance metrics for visualization

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate (Day 5)
- Connect events to WebSocket for real-time updates
- Test event flow end-to-end
- Create event aggregation views

### Week 3: Caching & Optimization
- Integrate cache package
- Add @Cacheable decorators
- Implement cache event tracking
- File system abstraction

## üí° Usage Examples

### Tracing a Request
```bash
# Find all events for a specific request
grep "correlationId\":\"xyz789" logs/events/*.log

# Monitor slow operations
grep "performance.slowOperation" logs/events/*.log | jq .

# Track GitHub API usage
grep "github.api.completed" logs/events/*.log | jq '.payload.rateLimitRemaining'
```

### Event Analysis
```bash
# Count events by type
jq -r .type logs/events/*.log | sort | uniq -c

# Average duration by operation
jq 'select(.type | endswith(".completed")) | {op: .type, dur: .payload.duration}' logs/events/*.log
```

## ‚ú® Summary

Phase 2 successfully implemented comprehensive event-driven traceability:
- All services emit structured events
- GraphQL operations fully tracked
- Performance monitoring automated
- Foundation ready for real-time dashboards

The system now provides complete visibility into all operations, enabling effective debugging, performance optimization, and production monitoring.
