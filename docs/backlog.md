## How to Use This Backlog

1. **Prioritization**: Items are listed in priority order within each section
2. **Status**: Each item should have a clear status (Not Started, In Progress, Blocked, Complete)
3. **Refinement**: Work items should be refined before starting implementation
4. **Updates**: Mark items complete and add new discoveries as work progresses

## 🚨 Current Priority: OpenAPI to GraphQL Migration

> **CURRENT SPRINT**: REST to GraphQL Federation Migration ⏱️ COMPLETED  
> **SPRINT GOAL**: Enforce all REST API calls go through GraphQL federation gateway
> 
> **SPRINT JUSTIFICATION**: 
> - UI components still make direct REST calls to GitHub and local APIs
> - GraphQL Mesh can transform OpenAPI sources to GraphQL automatically
> - Single API endpoint provides consistency and better monitoring
> - ADR-020 mandates all REST through federation
>
> **COMPLETED THIS SPRINT**:

> 10. ✅ Created migration guide for tracking progress
>
> **NEXT IMMEDIATE TASKS**:
> - [ ] Update UI components to use new GraphQL services
> - [ ] Remove all direct fetch() calls from components
> - [ ] Test GitHub operations through federation gateway
> - [ ] Update environment variables documentation
> - [ ] Remove old REST service implementations
