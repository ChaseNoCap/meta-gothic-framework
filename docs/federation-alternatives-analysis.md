# GraphQL Federation Alternatives Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes three major GraphQL federation alternatives for the Meta GOTHIC framework's long-term architecture, with a focus on Fastify compatibility and production readiness.

**Recommendation**: **WunderGraph Cosmo** for production, **GraphQL Mesh** for immediate adoption.

---

## 1. GraphQL Mesh

### Overview
GraphQL Mesh is an open-source framework by The Guild that acts as a gateway for GraphQL and non-GraphQL sources, with strong federation support.

### Fastify Compatibility
- **Excellent**: Native Fastify integration via `@graphql-mesh/fastify`
- Can run as Fastify plugin or standalone gateway
- Preserves Mercurius performance benefits at subgraph level

### Key Features
- **Federation v2 Support**: Full compatibility, including all v2.x directives
- **Performance**: 2x faster than Apollo Gateway (JavaScript comparison)
- **Multi-Source**: Can federate GraphQL, REST, gRPC, databases
- **Type Safety**: Automatic TypeScript generation
- **Plugins**: Extensive plugin ecosystem

### Architecture Example
```typescript
// mesh.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@graphql-mesh/compose-cli'

export default defineConfig({
  subgraphs: [
    {
      name: 'repo-agent',
      endpoint: 'http://localhost:3004/graphql'
    },
    {
      name: 'claude',
      endpoint: 'http://localhost:3002/graphql'
    }
  ],
  serve: {
    fastify: true,
    port: 3000
  }
})
```

### Pros
- ✅ Excellent Fastify integration
- ✅ Works with existing Mercurius services
- ✅ Open source (MIT license)
- ✅ Active development by The Guild
- ✅ Can transform non-GraphQL sources
- ✅ Built-in caching and performance optimizations

### Cons
- ❌ Smaller community than Apollo
- ❌ Less enterprise tooling
- ❌ Documentation can be fragmented

### Migration Path
1. Install `@graphql-mesh/cli` and `@graphql-mesh/fastify`
2. Create mesh configuration
3. Point to existing Mercurius services
4. Gradually add federation features

## 2. WunderGraph Cosmo

### Overview
WunderGraph Cosmo is a complete GraphQL federation platform that has rapidly gained market share (87% adoption in 2024 per State of GraphQL Federation report).

### Fastify Compatibility
- **Good**: Gateway runs as separate process (Go-based)
- Subgraphs remain Fastify/Mercurius
- Provides SDKs for Node.js integration

### Key Features
- **Federation v2 Support**: Full compatibility plus proprietary extensions
- **Performance**: 10x faster than Apollo Gateway (Go vs JavaScript)
- **Router**: Production-grade with built-in observability
- **Studio**: Comprehensive schema registry and analytics
- **Open Source**: Router is Apache 2.0 licensed

### Architecture
```yaml
# cosmo.yaml
federation:
  version: v2
subgraphs:
  - name: repo-agent
    url: http://localhost:3004/graphql
    schema: 
      file: ./repo-agent-schema.graphql
  - name: claude
    url: http://localhost:3002/graphql
    schema:
      file: ./claude-schema.graphql
```

### Pros
- ✅ Fastest federation router (Go-based)
- ✅ Production-grade with enterprise features
- ✅ Excellent observability and tracing
- ✅ Schema registry included
- ✅ Strong adoption momentum
- ✅ Works with any GraphQL server

### Cons
- ❌ Newer platform (less mature ecosystem)
- ❌ Router runs as separate process
- ❌ Some features require paid plan
- ❌ Learning curve for platform

### Migration Path
1. Keep existing Mercurius services unchanged
2. Deploy Cosmo Router
3. Register schemas in Cosmo Studio
4. Configure routing and composition
5. Add observability and monitoring

## 3. GraphQL Yoga + Envelop

### Overview
GraphQL Yoga v5 is a fully-featured GraphQL server with a plugin-based architecture through Envelop.

### Fastify Compatibility
- **Excellent**: Native Fastify integration
- Can replace Mercurius entirely
- Similar performance characteristics

### Key Features
- **Federation Support**: Via `@envelop/apollo-federation` plugin
- **Performance**: Comparable to Mercurius
- **Plugins**: 50+ plugins available
- **Type Safety**: First-class TypeScript support
- **Subscriptions**: Built-in WebSocket support

### Implementation
```typescript
import { createYoga } from 'graphql-yoga'
import { useApolloFederation } from '@envelop/apollo-federation'
import fastify from 'fastify'

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema: federatedSchema,
  plugins: [
    useApolloFederation({
      version: 2
    })
  ]
})

const app = fastify()
app.route({
  url: '/graphql',
  method: ['GET', 'POST'],
  handler: async (req, reply) => {
    const response = await yoga.handle(req, reply)
    return response
  }
})
```

### Pros
- ✅ Excellent Fastify integration
- ✅ Modern, actively maintained
- ✅ Great plugin ecosystem
- ✅ Good TypeScript support
- ✅ Unified server (not just gateway)

### Cons
- ❌ Would require migrating from Mercurius
- ❌ Federation is via plugin (not native)
- ❌ Smaller community than Apollo

## 4. Alternative Options

### Hasura GraphQL Engine
- **Compatibility**: Limited (prefers PostgreSQL)
- **Use Case**: Better for database-first architectures
- **Not Recommended**: Doesn't fit your architecture

### Apollo GraphOS (Full Stack)
- **Compatibility**: Requires Apollo Server
- **Performance**: Would lose Mercurius benefits
- **Cost**: Expensive for enterprise features
- **Not Recommended**: Unless willing to fully migrate

### Stellate
- **Type**: CDN/Edge layer, not federation
- **Use Case**: Performance optimization
- **Consider**: As additional layer later
