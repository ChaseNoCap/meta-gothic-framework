# SSE Implementation Summary

**Date**: January 7, 2025

## What We Accomplished

Successfully implemented SSE (Server-Sent Events) subscriptions for the Claude service through Cosmo Router federation, including critical bug fixes for session management.

### Key Components Implemented

1. **Custom SSE Handler** (`/services/claude-service/src/sse-handler.ts`)
   - Handles GraphQL subscriptions over SSE transport
   - Implements proper SSE protocol with heartbeats (30s intervals)
   - Supports both GET and POST requests
   - Includes error handling and automatic cleanup

2. **Service Integration**
   - Claude service exposes SSE at `/graphql/stream`
   - Integrated into main service startup
   - Works with existing subscription resolvers
   - Fixed critical bugs in session management

3. **Cosmo Router Configuration**
   - Successfully configured for SSE protocol
   - Generated proper federation config using `wgc router compose`
   - Router federates SSE subscriptions correctly
   - Added subgraph SDL schemas to configuration

4. **Critical Bug Fixes**
   - **Session ID Issue**: Claude CLI requires UUID format, not nanoid
     - Added `claudeSessionId` field to track Claude's actual session ID
     - Modified resume logic to use Claude's UUID instead of internal ID
   - **Promise Handling**: Fixed executeCommand resolver to await output promise
   - **This Binding**: Fixed `getActiveSessions()` method's context binding

### Service Implementation Status

| Service | SSE Support | Reason |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Claude Service | ✅ Implemented | Has subscriptions for real-time output |
| Git Service | ❌ Not Needed | No subscriptions defined in schema |
| GitHub Adapter | ❌ Not Applicable | REST API adapter, not GraphQL |

### How It Works

```bash
# SSE subscriptions work through the main GraphQL endpoint
curl -N -X POST http://localhost:4000/graphql \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"subscription { commandOutput(sessionId: \"...\") { ... } }"}'
```

The Cosmo Router:
1. Receives SSE subscription request at main endpoint
2. Routes to appropriate subgraph (Claude service)
3. Establishes SSE connection to subgraph's `/graphql/stream`
4. Streams events back to client

### Testing Results

Successfully tested with real Claude sessions:
```
Session: x_N6loZ85e9L8BIXd109i
Claude UUID: 81f2880e-e85b-4473-8874-23b7beef3184
Query: "What is 3+3?" → Response: "6"
Resume: "What was the previous calculation?" → Response: "3+3"
```

### Current Status

✅ **Working**:
- SSE handler implementation with heartbeat
- Federation configuration with proper SDL schemas
- Subscription routing through Cosmo Router
- Error handling and reconnection support
- Session persistence with proper UUID handling

⚠️ **Notes**:
- Git Service has no subscriptions, so SSE not implemented
- GitHub Adapter is REST-based, no SSE needed
- Claude sessions require CLAUDE_DANGEROUS_MODE=true for bash commands
- Client needs to handle reconnection logic

### Next Steps

1. **Production Deployment**
   - Configure PM2 for process management
   - Set up proper logging and monitoring
   - Configure rate limiting for SSE connections

2. **Client Integration**
   - Update Apollo Client to use SSE link for subscriptions
   - Test real-time features in UI components
   - Add reconnection logic for resilience

3. **Future Enhancements**
   - If Git Service needs real-time features, add subscriptions to schema first
   - Consider file watching subscriptions for Git Service
   - Implement progress tracking for long-running operations

The foundation for real-time streaming is now in place and working correctly through the federated gateway with all critical issues resolved.
