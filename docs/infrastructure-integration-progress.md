# Infrastructure Integration Progress Report

## Overview

Started implementing the infrastructure integration phase to enable end-to-end traceability and observability across the metaGOTHIC framework.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Structured Logging Implementation âœ…

#### Claude Service
- Updated logger initialization to use standard pattern: `createLogger(service, context, config)`
- Enabled event tracking plugin with 500ms slow query threshold
- Integrated ClaudeSessionManagerWithEvents for automatic event emission
- Added request-scoped event bus with correlation ID support
- Updated event logger in eventBus.ts to use standard pattern

#### Repo Agent Service
- Already fully configured with:
  - Event tracking plugin (200ms threshold)
  - GitServiceWithEvents for automatic event emission
  - Request-scoped event bus with correlation ID
  - Structured logging with child loggers

#### Meta Gothic App (Gateway)
- Already configured with:
  - Event tracking plugin (1000ms threshold)
  - WebSocket event broadcaster
  - Request-scoped event bus
  - Structured logging

### 2. Correlation ID Flow âœ…

All services now implement consistent correlation ID flow:

```typescript
// 1. Generate or extract correlation ID at gateway
const correlationId = request.headers.get('x-correlation-id') || nanoid();

// 2. Create child logger with correlation ID
const requestLogger = logger.child({
  correlationId,
  method: request.method,
  url: request.url,
});

// 3. Create request-scoped event bus
const eventBus = createRequestEventBus(correlationId);

// 4. Pass through context to all operations
```

### 3. Event Emission Architecture âœ…

#### Event Bus Implementation
- LoggingEventBus extends base EventBus with automatic logging
- Events categorized by type (started, completed, failed, performance)
- Appropriate log levels for each event type
- Event metadata includes correlation ID for tracing

#### Event Types Supported
- `claude.session.*` - Claude session lifecycle events
- `repo.*` - Git operation events
- `graphql.*` - GraphQL operation events
- `performance.*` - Performance monitoring events
- `github.*` - GitHub API events

### 4. Log Organization Structure âœ…

Created comprehensive log directory structure:

```
logs/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.json                    # Log file index with metadata
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ claude-service/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app-{date}.log       # General application logs
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ error-{date}.log     # Error logs only
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ performance-{date}.log # Performance metrics
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sessions/            # Claude session logs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ repo-agent-service/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app-{date}.log
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ git-operations-{date}.log
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ scans/               # Repository scan logs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ gateway/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ access-{date}.log    # HTTP access logs
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ graphql-{date}.log   # GraphQL operations
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ federation-{date}.log # Service routing
â”œâ”€â”€ graphql/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ queries/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mutations/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ subscriptions/
â”œâ”€â”€ ai-operations/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ claude-sessions/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ commit-generation/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ token-usage/
â”œâ”€â”€ system/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ health-checks/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ performance/
â””â”€â”€ events/                      # Centralized event logs
```

## Infrastructure Packages Status

### âœ… Integrated
1. **@chasenocap/logger** - Fully integrated across all services
2. **@chasenocap/event-system** - Event bus and decorators active

### ðŸ”„ Next to Integrate
3. **@chasenocap/cache** - For caching expensive operations
4. **@chasenocap/file-system** - For file operation abstraction

## Key Patterns Established

### 1. Logger Initialization
```typescript
const logger = createLogger('service-name', {}, {
  logDir: join(__dirname, '../../logs/service-name')
});
```

### 2. Event-Enabled Services
```typescript
// Use event-enabled versions of services
const sessionManager = new ClaudeSessionManagerWithEvents(
  eventBus, 
  requestLogger, 
  correlationId
);

const gitService = new GitServiceWithEvents(
  WORKSPACE_ROOT,
  eventBus,
  requestLogger,
  correlationId
);
```

### 3. Event Tracking Plugin
```typescript
useEventTracking({
  serviceName: 'service-name',
  slowQueryThreshold: 500 // milliseconds
})
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **End-to-End Traceability**: Every request can be traced through all services via correlation ID
2. **Automatic Event Emission**: Services emit lifecycle events without manual code
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Slow operations automatically detected and logged
4. **Structured Logging**: Consistent log format across all services
5. **Event-Driven Debugging**: All operations emit events for debugging

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Add Caching Decorators** - Implement @Cacheable for expensive operations
2. **File System Abstraction** - Replace direct fs usage with IFileSystem
3. **Performance Dashboards** - Create real-time performance monitoring
4. **Event Stream Visualization** - Build event flow visualization

### Configuration Needed
1. Set up log rotation with logrotate
2. Configure log shipping to centralized service
3. Set up alerts for error rates
4. Create performance baselines

## Usage Examples

### Tracing a Request
```bash
# Find all logs for a specific correlation ID
grep -r "correlationId.*abc123" logs/

# View event flow for a correlation ID
jq 'select(.correlationId == "abc123")' logs/events/*.json | jq -s 'sort_by(.timestamp)'
```

### Monitoring Performance
```bash
# Find slow operations
jq 'select(.duration > 1000)' logs/system/performance/*.json

# View Claude session performance
jq '.tokenCount' logs/ai-operations/claude-sessions/*.json | jq -s add
```

### Debugging Errors
```bash
# Find all errors in the last hour
find logs -name "*.log" -mmin -60 | xargs grep -l "error"

# View error details with context
grep -B5 -A5 "error" logs/services/*/error-*.log
```

## Conclusion

The infrastructure integration has successfully established:
- Comprehensive logging with correlation IDs
- Automatic event emission for all key operations
- Structured log organization for easy analysis
- Foundation for real-time monitoring and debugging

The framework now has production-grade observability capabilities that will enable efficient debugging, performance monitoring, and operational insights.
