# Federation Migration Complete

## Date: 2025-06-05

### Changes Made

1. **Removed old non-federated gateway**
   - Renamed `services/meta-gothic-app/src/gateway.ts` to `gateway.ts.old`
   - This file used schema stitching and is no longer needed
   - All services now use the federation gateway (`gateway-federation.ts`)

2. **Updated UI to work with federation**
   - Fixed GraphQL queries to use correct field names:
     - `perPage` → `first` for repository queries
     - Removed fields not available in GitHub Mesh service (`bio`, `company`, `publicRepos`, `topics`, `openIssuesCount`)
   - Temporarily disabled workflow functionality as it's not available in the GitHub Mesh service

3. **Current Architecture**
   ```
   Federation Gateway (Port 3000)
   ├── Claude Service (Port 3002) - GraphQL Yoga
   ├── Repo Agent Service (Port 3004) - GraphQL Yoga  
   └── GitHub Mesh Service (Port 3005) - GraphQL Mesh with OpenAPI
   ```

### TODO

1. **Add workflow support to federation**
   - Option 1: Extend GitHub Mesh configuration to include Actions API
   - Option 2: Create a separate GitHub Actions subgraph service
   - Option 3: Add workflow resolvers directly to the federation gateway

2. **Clean up old files**
   - Remove `gateway.ts.old` after confirming everything works
   - Remove references to non-federated gateway in documentation

3. **Update GitHub service**
   - Consider replacing GraphQL Mesh with a custom GraphQL Yoga service
   - This would give us more control over the schema and allow adding custom fields
