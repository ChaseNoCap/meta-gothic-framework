# REST to GraphQL Migration Complete

## Migration Summary

The metaGOTHIC UI components have been fully migrated from REST to GraphQL. All API calls now go through the GraphQL federation gateway, implementing ADR-005 (GraphQL-First Architecture) and ADR-021 (Direct GitHub REST Wrapping).

## What Was Done

### 1. Created GraphQL Services
- `githubServiceGraphQL.ts` - GitHub operations via GraphQL
- `gitServiceGraphQL.ts` - Git operations via GraphQL  
- `claudeServiceGraphQL.ts` - Claude AI operations via GraphQL
- `changeReviewServiceGraphQL.ts` - Comprehensive change review via GraphQL

### 2. Updated UI Components
- ✅ Removed `ManualCommit` (redundant with ChangeReview)
- ✅ Created `RepositoryStatusGraphQL` 
- ✅ Created `ClaudeConsoleGraphQL`
- ✅ Created `PipelineControlGraphQL`
- ✅ Updated all components to use GraphQL services

### 3. Removed REST Dependencies
- ✅ Deleted old REST service files:
  - `api.ts`, `dataFetcher.ts`, `githubServiceMock.ts`
  - `toolsService.ts`, `toolsDataFetcher.ts`
- ✅ Removed REST-based pages
- ✅ Cleaned up test/demo files
- ✅ Removed proxy configuration from Vite
- ✅ Updated service exports to use GraphQL by default

### 4. Updated Documentation
- ✅ Created ADR-021 for Direct GitHub REST Wrapping
- ✅ Updated ADR-015 to mark hybrid approach as superseded
- ✅ Updated environment variables documentation
- ✅ Created GraphQL architecture guide

## Architecture Overview

```
UI Components (Apollo Client)
          ↓
    GraphQL Gateway
    (Port 3001)
       ↙     ↘
Claude Service  Repo Agent Service
(Port 3002)     (Port 3004)
```

## Environment Variables

### Required
```bash
VITE_GRAPHQL_URL=http://localhost:3001/graphql
VITE_GRAPHQL_WS_URL=ws://localhost:3001/graphql
VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
```

### Removed (No Longer Needed)
- `VITE_API_URL`
- `VITE_GIT_API_URL`
- Proxy configurations in vite.config.ts

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Single API Endpoint**: All requests through GraphQL gateway
2. **Type Safety**: Generated TypeScript types from schema
3. **Better Caching**: Field-level caching with Apollo
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket subscriptions
5. **Consistent Auth**: Handled at gateway level
6. **GraphQL-First**: Complies with ADR-005 and ADR-021

## GitHub OpenAPI Status

While the OpenAPI transformation is configured in `.meshrc.yaml`, it's not yet active in the running gateway. GitHub operations can be:
1. Added to repo-agent-service as GraphQL operations
2. Or the mesh gateway can be updated to include OpenAPI sources

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Verify all GraphQL operations in production
2. **Performance**: Monitor and optimize query performance
3. **GitHub Integration**: Add missing GitHub operations to repo-agent-service
4. **Monitoring**: Add APM and error tracking

## Files Kept for Reference

Some original REST implementations are kept with "Legacy" suffix for reference during the transition period. These can be fully removed once GraphQL is verified in production.
