# GraphQL Commit Operation Fix - Complete Solution

## Issues Fixed

### 1. REST API Dependency
- **Issue**: Commit operation was trying to use REST API on port 3003 which wasn't running
- **Fix**: Changed to use the currently selected service (GraphQL when in GraphQL mode)

### 2. GraphQL Schema Mismatches
- **Issue**: Mutation was querying fields that don't exist in the schema
- **Fix**: Updated BATCH_COMMIT_MUTATION to match actual schema:
  - Removed `failureCount` field (doesn't exist)
  - Removed nested `result` object structure
  - Updated to use direct fields: `success`, `commitHash`, `error`, `repository`, etc.

### 3. Input Structure Mismatch
- **Issue**: BatchCommitInput expects `commits` field, not `repositories`
- **Fix**: Updated input structure to use:
  ```javascript
  {
    commits: [{
      repository: path,
      message: commitMessage,
      files: [],
      stageAll: true
    }],
    continueOnError: true
  }
  ```

### 4. Service Interface Issues
- **Issue**: GraphQL service wasn't exposing batchCommit and batchPush methods
- **Fix**: Added these methods to the exported interface

## Files Modified

1. `/packages/ui-components/src/pages/ChangeReview.tsx`
   - Changed from `changeReviewService` to `reviewService` for commits

2. `/packages/ui-components/src/graphql/operations.ts`
   - Updated BATCH_COMMIT_MUTATION to match actual schema

3. `/packages/ui-components/src/services/graphqlChangeReviewService.ts`
   - Fixed input structure for batchCommit
   - Fixed response handling (removed nested result object)
   - Added batchCommit and batchPush to exported interface

4. `/packages/ui-components/src/services/graphqlParallelChangeReviewService.ts`
   - Updated mutation to match schema (already had correct input structure)

## Result

When using GraphQL mode, the "Commit All" button now:
- Sends commits through the GraphQL gateway
- Uses the correct mutation structure
- Properly handles responses
- Shows success/error messages correctly

Push functionality is not yet implemented in the GraphQL services and will show an appropriate error message.
