# Test Change Detection

This is a test file to verify that the dashboard can detect new uncommitted changes in real-time.

## Purpose
- Verify git status detection works with new files
- Test that dashboard updates when scanning for changes
- Ensure no static/mock data is being used

## Expected Behavior
When this file is created, the Tools page should show:
1. This file as an untracked change (`??` status)
2. Any other actual uncommitted changes
3. Real data updates every time "Scan for Changes" is clicked
