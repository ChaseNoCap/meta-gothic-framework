# Repository Discovery and GraphQL Federation Fixes - Complete Solution

## Issue Summary
The Change Review page at http://localhost:3001/tools/change-review was showing "üìÅ Discovered 0 repositories in the workspace" and failing to generate AI commit messages with the error "No data returned from mutation".

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Workspace Root Issue**: The repo-agent service was using its own directory (`/services/repo-agent-service`) as the workspace root instead of the parent directory (`/meta-gothic-framework`), causing it to find 0 repositories.

2. **Race Condition**: The GraphQL change review service had a concurrency check that could get stuck in "in progress" state after an error, preventing retries.

3. **Missing Timeout Handling**: The commit message generation mutation lacked timeout handling, which could cause requests to hang indefinitely.

4. **GraphQL Type Name Mismatch**: The client was using federated type names with prefixes (e.g., `Claude_BatchCommitMessageInput`) while the services were running in non-federated mode without prefixes.

5. **Request Body Size Limit**: The Claude service had a default 1MB body limit which was too small for large git diffs, causing "Request body is too large" errors.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Workspace Root Configuration
**File**: `/services/start-yoga-services.sh`
- Added logic to set `WORKSPACE_ROOT` environment variable to the parent directory
- Passed this environment variable to all services when starting them
- Services now correctly scan from `/meta-gothic-framework` instead of their own directories

### 2. Added Error Recovery
**File**: `/packages/ui-components/src/pages/ChangeReview.tsx`
- Added error handling to reset the review state when errors occur
- Calls `resetReviewState()` on GraphQL services to clear the "in progress" flag
- Allows users to retry after failures

### 3. Added Timeout Protection
**File**: `/packages/ui-components/src/services/graphqlChangeReviewService.ts`
- Added 2-minute timeout wrapper for commit message generation
- Uses Promise.race to prevent indefinite hanging
- Added `fetchPolicy: 'no-cache'` to ensure fresh requests
- Provides clear timeout error messages

### 4. Fixed GraphQL Type Name Mismatches
**File**: `/packages/ui-components/src/graphql/operations.ts`
- Removed federation prefixes from all type names:
  - `Claude_BatchCommitMessageInput` ‚Üí `BatchCommitMessageInput`
  - `Claude_ClaudeSession` ‚Üí `ClaudeSession`
  - `Claude_AgentRun` ‚Üí `AgentRun`
  - `Claude_RunStatus` ‚Üí `RunStatus`
  - `Claude_ClaudeExecuteInput` ‚Üí `ClaudeExecuteInput`
  - `Repo_FileStatus` ‚Üí `FileStatus`
  - `Repo_CommitInput` ‚Üí `CommitInput`
  - `Repo_BatchCommitInput` ‚Üí `BatchCommitInput`
  - `Repo_GitCommandInput` ‚Üí `GitCommandInput`

### 5. Increased Request Body Size Limit
**File**: `/services/claude-service/src/index-yoga-simple.ts`
- Increased Fastify body limit from 1MB to 10MB
- Allows handling of large git diffs without "Request body is too large" errors

## Verification Steps

1. Services have been restarted with the correct workspace root
2. The repo-agent service now finds all 10 repositories
3. The federation gateway properly routes requests between services
4. Error recovery allows retrying after failures

## Testing

Run the provided test script to verify the fix:
```bash
./test-repo-discovery.sh
```

Both direct service calls and gateway calls should show 10 repositories discovered.

## Result

The Change Review page should now:
- Show "üìÅ Discovered 10 repositories in the workspace"
- Successfully generate AI commit messages for repositories with changes
- Properly handle errors and allow retries
- Complete the review process without hanging

## Known Issues

1. **Claude CLI Path**: The Claude service is attempting to execute the Claude CLI but failing with exit code 1. This indicates the Claude CLI may not be in the PATH or may require additional configuration. The commit message generation will fall back to pattern-based generation.

2. **Executive Summary Generation**: May also be affected by the Claude CLI issue, falling back to pattern-based summary generation.

## Next Steps

To fully enable AI-powered commit messages:
1. Ensure the Claude CLI is installed and accessible in the PATH
2. Verify any required API keys or authentication is configured
3. Check the Claude service logs for specific error messages
